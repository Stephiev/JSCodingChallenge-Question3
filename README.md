JavaScript Coding Challenge Question 3 - Modeling a Library

This is my solution to the JavaScript Development Accelerator coding challenge question 3.

Challenge:
Model a library using objects. *
A library contains shelves. Shelves contain books. Books have an author and a title. Give the library methods to add and remove a shelf. A shelf should have methods to add/remove a book. Use a modular approach so that each type of object is contained in its own file. Add any functionality you think appropriate.

Explanation of code:
A modular approach was used as requested, each object is contained in its own file. Necessary files were loaded in their respective locations. In script.js, an example library was made to test the code.
